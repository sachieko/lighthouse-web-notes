### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in WSL.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

### Reply

I eat these operators in their sleep. Teach me how to iterate over an array diagonally efficiently. :D

 * Modify the contents of the function below, such that:
 *
 * If we're not hungry, we want to tell ourselves to get back to work.
 * Otherwise, we want to pick something up and eat it in the lab when

 * got between 20 and 30 minutes. If we have any more time than that,
 * we want to remind ourselves that we're in a bootcamp and that we
